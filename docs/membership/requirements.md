# What You'll Need

All RCOS students will need a few belongings to succeed:
- Laptop (recommended specifications below)
- [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

For software-based projects:
- Text editor or IDE

## Recommendations

### Operating Systems
If you choose to work in a code-intensive role, we highly recommend a Unix-based operating system.

If you have a Mac, you're all set! Your next step is to familiarize yourself with the terminal if you haven't already.

If you have a Windows PC, we highly recommend installing a Linux distribution. [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) is a good choice for beginners.

### Text Editors and IDEs
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - all-purpose IDE
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Mac-only, recommended for iOS development
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - minimalist, flexible, easy to use even for beginners
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - very customizable, very Github friendly
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - terminal-based text editor, very barebones (recommended for Raspberry Pi projects as you may not be able to access Sublime on a Pi)
