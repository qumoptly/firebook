<!-- # Speed Dating -->

<!-- Finding a team in RCOS isn't a requirement, but can often make RCOS easier for everyone. There are many ways to find a team but the easiest way is to look for teams during RCOS Pitch Days (the day when people say what projects they're going to be working on). If you're still looking for a team after pitch day, talk to your mentor or look for other groups in your small group. -->



# Speed Dating

## Overview

The goal of project Speed Dating is to ensure that each student finds a project that matches their interests. Finding a project can be very nerve-wracking, especially for new members. Speed Dating was introduced to address this problem.

Speed Dating should take place the meeting directly after pitch day but **must** take place before the first small group meeting. During Speed Dating, each project that is currently seeking new members is made easily visible to all members seeking projects. For this reason, it is crucial that all projects and members are present in the same room.

## Why Speed Dating?
One of the major components of the RCOS experience is finding an interesting project to work on. Finding a project for the first time can be a difficult task for newcomers to RCOS. In the past, members would email project leads after the leads would pitch their project on Pitch Day. While this method works it means that some students would not email certain projects since they felt unprepared due to a lack of open-source contributions.

**Speed Dating was created to mitigate this problem.** By having representatives from each project promote their project to RCOS members, this approach both puts new members at ease (since they will be able to ask more questions in person) and helps projects define how to promote themselves to new members.

## Protocol
<!-- Speed Dating must occur before the first small group meeting of the year. For a project to qualify for the speed dating process they must have an outline of their proposal approved by a coordinator or mentor. This outline must be approved by a coordinator or mentor 48 hours before the speed dating process. After approval each project must pick one person to act as a representative of the project. The rep will be given a sign with their project name on it and then the representatives will begin talking to anyone interested in joining the project. The rep should make sure that anyone interested in their project gets their email and a link to the projects' main communication channel. After the speed dating process has finished, the next order of business will be for projects so submit their proposals for approval by coordinators. -->

Projects should participate in Speed Dating if and only if they are still looking for new members.

Once the list of participating projects has been established, a numbered list should be compiled and documented. Each project taking part in the event will be assigned an ID number corresponding to its list enumeration.

Each project should also select one representative who is well informed of the project’s goals and needs. This representative should be given a sign to wear that identifies which project they are promoting, the project’s ID number, their name, and their contact information. *The coordinators should prepare signs for each participating project in advance of this meeting.*


When Speed Dating begins, representatives should arrange themselves in the front of the room according to their assigned ID number. A key of assigned numbers to projects should be displayed on the projector to make it easier to find projects (this key should correlate to the numbered list mentioned above).

It is advised that coordinators bring a couple print outs of the current semester’s pitch slide deck, so members can flip through and refresh their memories about project details and technology stack used.

Once the representatives are all in place, members are instructed to find a project if they do not already have one. Members should speak to reps for projects they find interesting and gain more information, and reps should be open to questions. **It is the rep’s responsibility to decide whether or not a member is suited for the role.**

Once a project has one to two members in addition to the representative, those members should move to the proposal approval room to work on the project proposal. Additionally, once a project has decided that it has enough members, the representative should bring their project sign to a mentor or coordinator. The mentor should strike through (~Project A~) projects that have concluded their search from the projected key on an ongoing basis.

**DO NOT delete the project from the list!!**

All project members should eventually relocate to the proposal approval room. Some projects will have this finalized before the Speed Dating event. In this case, they should go right to the proposal approval room.

**All members mustselect a project, and have their proposals written and approved before leaving.**

## Mentors

Mentors should be present to guide members to projects that they are well suited for. This is also a chance for mentors to direct members to higher priority or sponsored projects. Mentors should make a conscious effort to reach out to and help students who look lost or anxious. Mentors must ensure that each student leaves Speed Dating with a project they are happy with.
