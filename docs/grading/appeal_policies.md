# Grade Appeal Policies

Every student taking RCOS for credit has an opportunity to appeal their final grade. The specific policies and process for appealing a grade are outlined below.

After grades are posted on SIS, you have a grace period of 7 days to request a grade appeal. To request a grade appeal, fill out [our appeal form](https://goo.gl/forms/q54w9Dyza2AprVom1) and send to a faculty advisor or coordinator.
