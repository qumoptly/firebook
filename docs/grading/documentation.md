# Documentation

Whether you are just starting out or you're a returning project, we strongly recommend that your repository have the following .md files:
- README
- License
- Current proposal
- Code of conduct
- Contributing guidelines
- Issue and/or pull request template

## README
Your README file is what people see when navigating to your repository. It should ideally be brief, but provide the following:
- Brief overview of your project
- How to setup your project on a local machine
- Where to find source code
- Where to find additional documentation

Here is a [recommended README template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) you can use to get started. 
>Note: if you just started your project, you may not have setup instructions yet. Be sure to update your README as your project progresses!

## License
From the Open Source Initiative:
>Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition â€” in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared. To be approved by the Open Source Initiative (also known as the OSI), a license must go through the Open Source Initiative's license review process.

Confused as to what this means? [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com) has an excellent guide on finding the right license for your project.

## Proposal
At the beginning of the semester, your team should write a proposal. Keep this in your repository for reference and modify it as needed so it is truly a living document. You may use the original document or convert to Markdown for ease of use.

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is an excellent tool for converting between markup formats, including converting from PDF/Word documents to Markdown.

## Code of Conduct
Our Community Code of Conduct outlines what we expect from members of the RCOS community. As your project grows, a community will hopefully grow with it. Your project is never too small to have a Code of Conduct in place to outline community guidelines and foster a welcoming community. You may use any Code of Conduct you wish, as long as it is compatible with our Community Code of Conduct.

We at RCOS have created a [Code of Conduct template](https://github.com/rcos/rcos-handbook/blob/master/docs/community/code_of_conduct_template.md) for your project based on our Code of Conduct. If you wish to use it, create a file in your repository's root folder called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and copy and paste the text, changing `[Your Project]` to your project's name.

Another popular option is the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) Code of Conduct, which can be dropped into your project very easily (and in fact, part of our Code of Conduct was modified from the Contributor Covenant).

If you would like to use another Code of Conduct, most existing Code of Conduct templates are compatible with our Community Code of Conduct. The only Code of Conduct templates which are **not** compatible with the RCOS Community Code of Conduct are those based on a "No Code of Conduct" policy.

## Contributing Guidelines
Your contributing guidelines should outline how to contribute to your project via issues or pull requests. 

Here is a [contributing template](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md) to get you started.

Once you have your contributing guidelines in place, a link to these guidelines will appear whenever someone opens an issue or pull request.

<!-- TODO: create a template specifically for RCOS projects -->

## Issue or Pull Request Template

GitHub allows you to create issue or pull request templates. [Here is information on how to create a template](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates/).

### Issue Template
If you choose to create an issue template, you are advised to create at least two templates: a bug template and a feature template. 

### Pull Request Template
GitHub will automatically create a pull request template for you. If you would like to add more to the template, feel free to do so.

## Additional Documentation

Additional documentation is strongly encouraged! There is no specific format you must follow for additional documentation, but here are a few ideas:
- Project blog
- API docs
- Wiki
- Static website
- Style guide
