# Status Updates

## Overview

**What are Status Updates?**

Status Updates are informal weekly short-form blog posts detailing a student's progress in RCOS during the previous week. **Each student should complete one status update per-week**.

**Why were Status Updates introduced?**

Status Updates were introduced to enable mentors and coordinators to better gauge each student's on-going progress during the semester. This solution replaces the previous requirement of 4 Blog Posts per-semester.

<!-- In the past we had requirements for varying numbers of blog posts to be written during the semester by students in RCOS. Many students would end up producing poorly written, rushed blog posts at the end of the semester to hit their quota - we decided that it would be easier for students to produce a small weekly update. -->

<!-- The inclusion of Status Updates in the RCOS grading rubric serves a practical purpose as well - as RCOS has grown as an organization it has become increasingly difficult for a small number of mentors and faculty advisors to gauge the ongoing work of individual students. Weekly Status Updates give mentors a week-by-week overview of the student's progress to better gauge whether or not a particular student is aligned with their goals for the semester. -->

<!-- In summary Status Updates ease the burden of writing "filler" blog posts, simplify the grading process, and enable mentors to ensure students are on-track with their semester goals. -->

**How are Status Updates tracked?**

Each student maintains their respective status updates in GitHub repository forked from [rcos/rcos-status-updates](https://github.com/rcos/rcos-status-updates). Please consult the `rcos/rcos-status-updates` repository for information on how to get started.
