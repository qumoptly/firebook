# Bylaws

Our Bylaws are an extension of our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The Bylaws apply to RCOS meetings at RPI, including large group and small group meetings as well as bonus sessions, casual coding sessions, and any project meetings unless otherwise noted.

## Summary
- Do not distribute attendance codes to people not attending the session. ([Attendance Codes](#attendance-codes))
- Respect speakers by not talking or making excessive noise while they are speaking. ([Noise](#noise))
- Be mindful of your audience when choosing a topic for your talk. ([Talks/Sensitive Topics](#sensitive-topics))
- Please keep any messages you send to a live demo professional and appropriate. ([Talks/Live Demos](#live-demos))
- You may use electronics during large group talks as long as you respect the people around you. ([Large Group/Electronics](#electronics))
- Some speakers may also ask that you close all laptops unless you are following along or taking notes.
- If you are an RPI student, you are also expected to comply with the [RPI Student Handbook](https://sexualviolence.rpi.edu/sites/default/files/Rensselaer%20Handbook%20of%20Student%20Rights%20%26%20Responsibilities%2C%20November%202017.pdf).
- Appropriate [consequences](#consequences-of-code-of-conduct-violations) may follow if you violate the Code of Conduct, Bylaws, or RPI Student Handbook. 

## Attendance Codes
Attendance codes are given during all RCOS small group, large group, and bonus sessions. When the attendance code is delivered, go to http://rcos.io, click "Attend", and enter the attendance code so you can be marked as present for the current session.

As much as we value sharing and openness, we also value integrity. Thus, we ask that you do not distribute attendance codes to people who are not currently attending the session. If you are caught distributing attendance codes to people who are absent, **both your attendance code as well as the attendance code(s) you distributed to others will be nullified**.

If you know in advance you will not be able to make an RCOS meeting, or unforeseen circumstances arise that make you unable to attend, please review our [Excused Absence Policy](/grading/attendance?id=excused-absence-policy) instead of attempting to enter an attendance code.

## Noise
An important part of RCOS is being able to hear from both fellow RCOS members and guest speakers. We ask that you please refrain from talking or making excessive noise while a speaker is talking as it can be disruptive to the speaker and to your peers.

## Talks

### Sensitive Topics

Please keep in mind that students, alumni, and faculty from a diverse range of backgrounds will be viewing your talk. In addition, students are required to attend a certain number of talks per semester.

Presentations containing detailed discussion of sensitive, upsetting, or controversial topics without warning can create an especially hostile environment when this is considered.

Presentations should not include any content that violates our [Code of Conduct](community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) or contains:
- Graphic violence or descriptions of violence
- Detailed and explicit discussions of potentially triggering topics (e.g. suicide, sexual assault, addiction, self-harm)
- Excessive profanity
- Nudity

If you're unsure about whether or not your talk conforms to the above guidelines, please reach out to a mentor or coordinator to discuss.

### Live Demos

Live demos can provide a way to make otherwise dry talks very engaging, especially in a larger setting. However, inappropriate content sent to the live demo may reflect poorly on the speaker and RCOS as a whole. Thus, we ask that the audience comply with the Code of Conduct and Bylaws in any content they send to a live demo.

## Large Group
During our large group sessions, we have the following policies.

### Electronics
RCOS likes to maintain a culture of freedom. If you choose to use your laptop or mobile device during large group presentations, you may do so as long as you are mindful of the people around you. This includes:

* Muting all audio
* Not participating in audio or video calls
* Ensuring any material that may be visible on your screen is SFW (safe for work)
* Keeping mobile devices on "Silent" or "Vibrate"
* Using a quiet keyboard instead of a loud keyboard

In addition, some speakers may ask audience members to put away all mobile devices and close all laptops unless they are using them to actively follow along or take notes. If a speaker does so, please respect their request.

If you absolutely must take a phone call, you can exit the lecture hall to make/take a phone call. If you need to call emergency services for any reason, you may remain in the room while you make the call.

## Consequences of Code of Conduct Violations
If you violate the RCOS Community Code of Conduct or Bylaws, appropriate consequences will follow at the discretion of faculty. In addition, if you are an RPI student, you must also comply with all policies in the [RPI Student Handbook](https://sexualviolence.rpi.edu/sites/default/files/Rensselaer%20Handbook%20of%20Student%20Rights%20%26%20Responsibilities%2C%20November%202017.pdf).

### Short Version
Consequences may include:
- Verbal, Slack, or written warnings
- Requests to edit or delete project material
- Removal from sessions
- Grade penalties
- Early ending of a talk or session
- Removal from RCOS with a failing grade for the semester
- Loss of mentorship privileges
- Referral to Dean of Students for violations of RPI Student Handbook
- Any other consequences that faculty advisors deem appropriate

See the long version below for details on what these penalties entail.

### Long Version

Consequences may include:

* A verbal or Slack warning from a mentor or coordinator
* A written warning from a faculty advisor
* A request to edit or delete any project material that violates the Code of Conduct 
  * Project material includes, but is not limited to, status updates, blog posts, code, comments, issues, pull requests, milestones, wiki pages, static websites, graphics, social media posts, etc. 
  * Failure to comply with this request may result in grade penalties as outlined below.
* Grade penalties on deliverables (including status updates, presentations, open source contributions, etc.) that contain inappropriate, unprofessional, or harassing content
  * TODO: flesh out what grade penalties are appropriate
  * For smaller deliverables such as status updates, this can result in losing half or all credit on the deliverable.
  * For larger deliverables such as presentations, this grade penalty can be up to 1 full letter grade.
* If your large group talk or bonus session violates the Code of Conduct, your talk may be ended early and your slides will not be published to the #slides channel.
* If the violation occurred at an RCOS event or meeting, you may be removed from the event or meeting. This will be marked as an unexcused absence regardless of whether or not you already entered an attendance code, and you will not be able to make up this absence by attending a bonus session.
* In severe and repeated violations, you may be removed from RCOS entirely.
  * If you are taking RCOS for credit, you will receive a failing grade for the semester.
  * If you are currently a mentor, your mentorship position will be terminated immediately and you will be ineligible to mentor in future semesters. The same rule applies to coordinators.
* If you have violated the [RPI Student Handbook](https://sexualviolence.rpi.edu/sites/default/files/Rensselaer%20Handbook%20of%20Student%20Rights%20%26%20Responsibilities%2C%20November%202017.pdf) along with our Code of Conduct and/or Bylaws, you may also be referred to the Dean of Students.

Please note that the above list is not exhaustive and additional consequences may follow as appropriate.
