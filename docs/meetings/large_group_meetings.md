# Large Group Meetings

## Overview
- What are large group meetings?
- Where / when do we meet?

## Announcements
Meetings begin with announcements. It's an opportunity for the coordinators to introduce the meeting's speakers & presentations. Any RCOS member is welcome to make an annoucement at the beginning of a meeting (in fact, it's encouraged!).

## Guest Speakers
RCOS welcomes guest speaksers to present their work or research and how it encorporates open-source software.
- TODO - add list of past guest speakers
- TODO - add a link to contact page (i.e. `If you're interesting in being a guest speaker, please contact xyz@rcos.io`)
