# Small Group Meetings

## Overview
- What are small group meetings?
- Where / when do we meet? (TODO - link to times & locations)

## Announcements
Meetings begin with announcements.

## Stand Up
Each project has an opportunity to give their small-group a brief update on their progress over the past week. Follows SCRUM format.

## Team Presentation Review
RCOS Teams should present their presentation during small-group the Tuesday before they present at the Large Group Meeting. Presentation Review provides students an opportunity to rehearse their presentation and receive feedback before presenting to the broader RCOS community.

## Open Hacking
The remaining time in the small group meetings is dedicated to working onyour project. This time allocation enables mentors to check in on each project and help resolve problems and guide their ongoing work.
